## McAfee-ePO-Autoinstaller
One problem facing organizations and entities that frequently configure new instances of ePO, is the time and consistency in making sure everything has been done properly.

The goal of this tool is to provide:
- Organization
- Consistency

This is achieved by preparing an archive of files that will be used by a script to import all of the desired items into the target ePO server, in the chosen order.

- Preconfigured Tasks

This solution, with a minor amount of preparation, performs these tasks quickly and easily
This ePO Automatic Installation tool performs these tasks from a simple configuration file
